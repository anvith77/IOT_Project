## Title 
 An Overview of Voice Assisted Head's up display for Low-Medium Segment Cars

## Abstract 
As per World Health Organization (WHO), road crashes kill 1.2 million people and permanently disable another 50 million every year. To overcome this problem a Head's up display (HUD) can be a viable solution, which is very effective in keeping the focus of the driver on the road by displaying/reflecting/projecting important information in the driver's line of sight. To supplement the HUD system we have integrated voice control along with dynamic feedback. 

## Conclusion 
The implemented Head's up Display system with Raspberry pi, OBD II, Voice Control caters to low-medium segment cars to provide an efficient distraction free driving experience with key parameters like the Speed,RPM,Temperatures,Load, etc, and voice control features like navigation, music, picking up calls. 
As the volume avalaible under the glare shield is limited, a compromise needs to be found, lIke Field Of View (FOV), Eye-Motion-Box (EMB) and display luminance. To make the HUD more robust, object tracking capability using Augmented Reality (AR) can be thought of.
